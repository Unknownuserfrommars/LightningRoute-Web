# LightningRoute-Web
Lightning Route Web Version - FROM SCRATCH

**Note that: THIS branch DOES NOT uses ANY code from ZhiDaoAI (main branch used), so it will be using the MIT License**

The brand-new mindmap making experience!

Uses AI to automatically summarize the text (text in the uploaded FILE/AUDIO/VIDEO[URL]) and creates an interactive graph.

VERY User-friendly and is easy-to-use.

Still working!

## Roadmap
- Get that MVP working
- Enhance UI
- ALL Python features -> HTML/CSS/JS
- MORE Features
- HOPEFULLY better OCR (by that i mean don't crash that often)
- Implement the subscription plan
- GET A DOMAIN!!!
